            <p>Code School is a brand new tutoring program based in Surrey</p>
            <p>I'm Danny and I'm a software developer, because of Covid-19 I've been at home a lot more and found myself needing something to do,
            I love teaching, my last teaching job before I knew how to code was at a drama school in Wigan 7 years ago, random I know but it was one of the best jobs I've ever had!
            <br>
            <p>I believe that everyone should know how to code (even just a little bit), I'm also a big believer in sharing skills which is why in June 2020 I decided to start up a 
                tutoring program for coding, with all lessons over Zoom. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>There's lots of different perceptions about coding the main one being a sweaty teenager spending too much time in their parents basement,
                and now even though that does have some truth too it coding is actually very broad and knowing just a little can get you pretty far in marketing, digital design,
                web development, loads more and even just advancing your basic computer literacy.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Code School is a brand new tutoring program aimed at giving a new skill to people who need it whether that be coding, a bit of digital design or some editing basics, my course if Â£5/hour until the end of November with the first intoductory lesson free, if you have any questions please got to my <a class="facebook-link" href="#contact-me">contact details</a> and get in touch!</p>
